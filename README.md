# 🚢 Titanic Dataset EDA – Survival Factors Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis project on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to understand which features influenced passenger survival using Python and data visualization techniques.

## 📁 Included Files

- `titanic_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with analysis, charts, and findings
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf`: Exported PDF report with summary
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`: Original dataset files

## 🔍 Highlights of the Analysis

- Cleaned missing data (Age, Embarked, etc.)
- Visualized key variables like Gender, Age, Pclass, and Fare
- Used boxplots, countplots, and heatmaps for deeper insights
- Summarized findings in both notebook and PDF report

## 📈 Insights Gained

- Survival chances were higher for **women** and **younger passengers**
- **First-class** passengers had better outcomes
- Passengers who paid **higher fares** were more likely to survive

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
